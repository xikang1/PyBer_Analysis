# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Project
We have applied Python skills and knowledge of Pandas to give a better view of total fares by city type by giving out a summary DataFrame for the ride-sharing data and a multiple-line graph that show the total weekly fares for each city type. We could have a actionable insight by the analysis result.

## Results
